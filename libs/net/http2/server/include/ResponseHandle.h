/**
 * @brief Thread-safe handle for sending responses asynchronously from worker threads.
 *
 * ResponseHandle enables worker threads to safely send HTTP/2 responses without
 * directly accessing nghttp2 response objects. It uses std::function to capture
 * the response object by reference and posts the send operation to the io_context
 * thread where the response object lives.
 *
 * Thread Safety:
 * - Worker threads hold weak_ptr<ResponseHandle>
 * - send() posts to io_context (non-blocking, async)
 * - Atomic flag prevents sending to closed streams
 * - io_context serialization prevents race with stream closure
 *
 * Lifetime:
 * - Created on request arrival (io_context thread)
 * - Passed to workers as shared_ptr
 * - Workers convert to weak_ptr (no ownership)
 * - Marked closed when stream closes
 * - If worker calls send() after closure, response is dropped gracefully
